# Cumulonimbus

**A simple, beautiful podcast web app.**

Admittedly, it isn't simple or beautiful yet. All in due course!

## Dependencies

Please install the following:

+ `foreman`
+ `node`
+ `npm`
+ `bower`

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install Node and Bower modules, respectively.

## Run

`cd` to the `cumulonimbus` directory.

Run `foreman start` to start. Cumulonimbus will now be running on `localhost` at port `3000` or the one defined in `.env`. Navigate there in a web browser to see it in action.
