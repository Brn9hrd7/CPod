## Dependencies

Please install the following:

+ `node`
+ `npm`
+ `bower`

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install Node and Bower modules, respectively.

## Run

`cd` to the `cumulonimbus` directory.

Run `npm start` to start. Cumulonimbus will now be running on `localhost` at port `3000` (or the one defined in `.env` if you used `foreman` to start). Navigate to that address in a web browser to see it in action.
