# Cumulonimbus

**A simple, beautiful podcast web app.**

Admittedly, it isn't simple or beautiful yet. All in due course!

## Run

`cd` to the `cumulonimbus` directory.

`npm install` to install dependencies.

`node index.js` to start. The Cumulonimbus server will now be running on `localhost` at port `3000`.
