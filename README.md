# Cumulonimbus

**A simple, beautiful podcast web app.**

Admittedly, it isn't simple or beautiful yet. All in due course!

## Dependencies

Cumulonimbus requires Foreman, Grunt, and a few node modules.

Run `npm install` to install dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Build

Run `grunt` to execute Grunt tasks.

## Run

`cd` to the `cumulonimbus` directory.

Run `foreman` to start. Cumulonimbus will now be running on `localhost` at port `3000`. Navigate there in a web browser to see it in action.
